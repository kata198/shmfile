/**
 * fshm_open - Open a shared memory stream, either creating a new
 *   stream [FSHM_OWNER] or mapping an existing stream [FSHM_GUEST],
 *   and returning a FILE* object with an associated int fd.
 *   This will work with both FILE* and int filedes functions
 *    (e.x.  fwrite and write, fread and read, etc).
 *
 *
 *  name - A unique name which corrosponds to this stream.
 *            If flags contain FSHM_OWNER, we attempt to create
 *             a stream using this name.
 *            Guests who wish to map this shmfile will provide
 *             this same name to reference which shmfile stream
 *             to map.
 *
 *  mode - An octal representing the "mode" for guest mappings.
 *           Mode has same meaning as with chmod.
 *         This mode will be used to determine how FSHM_GUEST
 *           mappings will be able to access this stream.
 *
 *         This field only has meaning when creating the shmfile ( FSHM_OWNER ).
 *          For an FSHM_GUEST open of an existing shmfile stream, this can be
 *            set to 0. Any other value will be ignored when flags contains FSHM_GUEST.
 *
 *         Columns:
 *
 *          - First column from left is always 0 for now (no sticky/setguid bit meaning)
 *          - Second column from left is permissions for owner (user who creates shmfile)
 *          - Third column from the left is permissions for users who share primary
 *            group with creating user
 *          - Fourth column from the left are permissions for any user which
 *            does NOT fall into any categories listed above
 *
 *         Values:
 *
 *          For each column, the number is derived by starting with 0
 *            and following these rules:
 *
 *           - Add 4 to allow guest mapping and read for represented set
 *           - Add 2 to allow writing to the mapping
 *           - Add 1 to allow execution
 *
 *
 *  Examples - Some examples of various #mode[s] and their meaning
 *
 *        Allow current user only to map as guest, read/write:
 *           0600
 *
 *        Allow current user only to map as guest, read-only:
 *           0400
 *
 *        Allow current user to map as guest, read and write,
 *          allow a different user belonging to same primary group
 *          to map as guest read-only:
 *           0640
 *
 *        Allow anybody on system to map read/write:
 *           0777
 *
 *
 *
 *  fshm_flags - A list of flags OR'd together
 *
 *     FSHM_OWNER  - Specifies that this call will create the stream
 *                    specified by #name . When the owner closes the stream,
 *                    it will be destroyed.
 *
 *     FSHM_GUEST  - Specifies that this call will open an existing stream
 *                    specified by #name . An FSHM_OWNER must have created
 *                    this stream already, or the call will fail.
 *                    Closing the stream as a guest will not destroy the file.
 *
 *  Return:
 *
 *     A FILE* object on success, otherwise NULL and errno is set.
 *
 *  NOTES:
 *
 *     The idea here is to simply allow interprocess I/O that exists
 *      only in memory. One process creates the mapping ( FSHM_OWNER )
 *      and several other processes can inherit that mapping,
 *      and share data between them.
 *
 *     There is a real FD associated with this FILE (unlike, open_memstream, for example).
 *
 *     You may choose to use either the buffered variants ( like fwrite, fread),
 *       or the unbuffered variants (like write, read).
 *
 *     Keep in mind that if you use the buffered functions, you must call fflush to
 *       sync the changes.
 *
 *
 *     You can use this object anywhere a FILE* is allowed, or anywhere an fd is allowed
 *      by calling fileno(X) where X is the FILE* returned by this function.
