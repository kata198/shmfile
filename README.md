# shmfile
Small shared library to use shared memory as a FILE\* , with interprocess communication in mind.



Basic Design
============

**Overview**

shmfile is desgined in an "owner/guest" format.

One process is the *owner* [FSHM\_OWMER] of a shared mapping (given by a string name). It creates the mapping, and can destroy it.


Other processes then can map that same string name as *guest* [FSHM\_GUEST].


The guest only needs to know the unique name that the owner picked to have access to the data.


**Permissions**

Permissions for who can map the same shm as FSHM\_GUEST and what they can do with the shmfile are specified by the octal: "mode".

These follow the same rules as chmod.

For example, same user only and read-only would be 0400. Same user r/w, all other users r/o, 0644


You specify the mode when the *owner* creates the shmfile, which will later determine whomelse on the system may have access.

The permissions are specified by the FSHM\_OWNER when creating the shmfile.

If fshm\_open is used instead of fshm\_guest\_open to map an existing shmfile stream as FSHM\_GUEST, the mode argument is ignored.


**Usage**


The *fshm\_open* is the core function that returns a FILE\* object, with a valid integer file descriptor [ fd ]. It is passed either FSHM\_OWNER or FSHM\_GUEST in the "flags" argument to define the operation.

The owner may also create an shmfile stream by using the helper function, *fshm\_create*, and a guest may also map an existing shmfile stream by using the helper function, *fshm\_guest\_open*.

You can read/write the data using either the buffered I/O functions (like fread, fwrite, fseek) and flushing with fflush, OR

the unbuffered I/O functions (like read, write, lseek) by using the fd returned by fileno( fileObj ) where fileObj is the FILE\* returned by one of the aforementioned functions. 


The size is completely automatic, you do not need to allocate an underlying buffer -- any data written to it and flushed will
expand the buffer automatically.


There is no built-in locking, so it's suggested if you are going to have multiple processes writing to the stream, 

that you either use fixed-size sections for each process, or implement your own locking.


Public Functions
----------------

The following functions make up the public API of shmfile.


**fshm\_create** - Create a new shmfile stream (convenience/helper function for fshm\_open with fshm\_flags as FSHM\_OWNER)

FILE\* fshm\_create(const char \*name, mode\_t mode)

	/**
	 * fshm_create - Create a new shmfile (as FSHM_OWNER)
	 *                 with a given mode.
	 *
	 *
	 *  name - A unique name which corrosponds to this stream.
	 *          Guests will use this name as a reference to map
	 *           this shmfile stream.
	 *
	 *  mode - An octal representing the "mode" for guest mappings.
	 *           Mode has same meaning as with chmod.
	 *         This mode will be used to determine how FSHM_GUEST
	 *           mappings will be able to access this stream.
	 *
	 *         See the 'fshm_open' function for more information
	 *          on mode.
	 *
	 *
	 *  RETURN VALUE - 
	 *                 A pointer to a FILE structure which may be used
	 *                  with standard io functions (e.x. fread, fprintf, fseek)
	 *
	 *                 On error, this function will return NULL and `errno' will be set
	 *
	 *  NOTES -
	 *                 * This is the same as calling fshm_open(name, mode, FSHM_OWNER)
	 *
	 *                 * See fshm_open for more info
	 */


**fshm\_guest\_open** - Opens an existing shmfile stream (convenience/helper function for fshm\_open with fshm\_flags as FSHM\_GUEST)


FILE \*fshm\_guest\_open(const char \*name);

	/**
	 * fshm_guest_open - Maps an existing shmfile stream (as FSHM_GUEST)
	 *                    using the given name for reference.
	 *
	 *
	 *  name - The name associated with an already-created fshmfile stream
	 *
	 *
	 *  RETURN VALUE -
	 *                 A pointer to a FILE structure which may be used
	 *                  with standard io functions (e.x. fread, fprintf, fseek)
	 *
	 *                 On error, this function will return NULL and `errno' will be set
	 *
	 *  NOTES -
	 *                 * This is the same as calling fshm_open(name, 0, FSHM_GUEST)
	 *
	 *                 * See fshm_open for more info
	 */

**fshm\_open** - Opens a shmfile stream

FILE\* fshm\_open(const char \*name, mode\_t mode, int fshm\_flags);


This is the "core" function, and can be used both to create a new shared memory stream or open an existing stream. The FILE pointer returned allows you to use all the other I/O systems that come standard with libc.


	/**
	 * fshm_open - Open a shared memory stream, either creating a new
     *   stream [FSHM_OWNER] or mapping an existing stream [FSHM_GUEST],
     *   and returning a FILE* object with an associated int fd.
	 *   This will work with both FILE* and int filedes functions
	 *    (e.x.  fwrite and write, fread and read, etc).
	 *
	 *  name - A unique name which corrosponds to this stream.
	 *            If flags contain FSHM_OWNER, we attempt to create
	 *             a stream using this name.
	 *            Guests who wish to map this shmfile will provide
	 *             this same name to reference which shmfile stream
	 *             to map.
	 *
	 *  mode - An octal representing the "mode" for guest mappings.
	 *           Mode has same meaning as with chmod.
	 *         This mode will be used to determine how FSHM_GUEST
	 *           mappings will be able to access this stream.
	 *
	 *         This field only has meaning when creating the shmfile ( FSHM_OWNER ).
	 *          For an FSHM_GUEST open of an existing shmfile stream, this can be
	 *            set to 0. Any other value will be ignored when flags contains FSHM_GUEST.
	 *
	 *         Columns:
	 *
	 *          - First column from left is always 0 for now (no sticky/setguid bit meaning)
	 *          - Second column from left is permissions for owner (user who creates shmfile)
	 *          - Third column from the left is permissions for users who share primary
	 *            group with creating user
	 *          - Fourth column from the left are permissions for any user which
	 *            does NOT fall into any categories listed above
	 *
	 *         Values:
	 *
	 *          For each column, the number is derived by starting with 0
	 *            and following these rules:
	 *
	 *           - Add 4 to allow guest mapping and read for represented set
	 *           - Add 2 to allow writing to the mapping
	 *           - Add 1 to allow execution
	 *
	 *
	 *  Examples - Some examples of various #mode[s] and their meaning
	 *
	 *        Allow current user only to map as guest, read/write:
	 *           0600
	 *
	 *        Allow current user only to map as guest, read-only:
	 *           0400
	 *
	 *        Allow current user to map as guest, read and write,
	 *          allow a different user belonging to same primary group
	 *          to map as guest read-only:
	 *           0640
	 *
	 *        Allow anybody on system to map read/write:
	 *           0777
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 *  fshm_flags - A list of flags OR'd together
	 *
	 *     FSHM_OWNER  - Specifies that this call will create the stream
	 *                    specified by #name . When the owner closes the stream,
	 *                    it will be destroyed.
	 *
	 *     FSHM_GUEST  - Specifies that this call will open an existing stream
	 *                    specified by #name . An FSHM_OWNER must have created
	 *                    this stream already, or the call will fail.
	 *                    Closing the stream as a guest will not destroy the file.
	 *
	 *  Return:
	 *
	 *     A FILE* object on success, otherwise NULL and errno is set.
	 *
	 *  NOTES:
	 *
	 *     The idea here is to simply allow interprocess I/O that exists
	 *      only in memory. One process creates the mapping ( FSHM_OWNER )
	 *      and several other processes can inherit that mapping,
	 *      and share data between them.
	 *
	 *     There is a real FD associated with this FILE (unlike, open_memstream, for example).
	 *
	 *     You may choose to use either the buffered variants ( like fwrite, fread),
	 *       or the unbuffered variants (like write, read).
	 *
	 *     Keep in mind that if you use the buffered functions, you must call fflush to
	 *       sync the changes.
	 *
	 *
	 *     You can use this object anywhere a FILE* is allowed, or anywhere an fd is allowed
	 *      by calling fileno(X) where X is the FILE* returned by this function.

**fshm\_chgrp** - Change the group associated with an shmfile stream

int fshm\_chgrp(FILE \*fshm\_file, gid\_t group)

	/**
	 * fshm_chgrp - Change the group associated with an existing shmfile stream
	 *
	 *      You must be the the same user as the FSHM_OWNER of the given stream,
	 *        or root in order to change the gid assigned to the shmfile.
	 *
	 *      The shmfile created by fshm_open is assigned the gid
	 *        matching the primary group of the creating user.
	 *
	 *      The purpose is to allow guests in a different group access rights to
	 *        this shmfile ( based on the group bits in the mode set with fshm_open ),
	 *        but not just open up access for everybody ( using the "other" bits in mode ).
	 *
	 *      As non-root, you may change the group to any groups to which you are a member.
	 *        This includes your primary gid as well as all supplementry groups to which you belong.
	 *        As root, you may change the shmfile's group to any group existing on this system.
	 *
	 *
	 *  fshm_file - A FILE* object as returned by fshm_open.
	 *                 You must be the FSHM_OWNER of this shmfile to change permissions.
	 *
	 *
	 *  group     - new gid to replace current group on this shmfile.
	 *
	 *                  If you are not root, this must be either your primary gid
	 *                    or a group contained in your list of supplementry groups.
	 *
	 *
	 *  RETURN VALUE -
	 *                   0:  Success
	 *                  -1:  Failure (and errno will be set)

**fshm\_force\_destroy** - Forcibly destroys a stream, as a recovery tool.

Use this function if the FSHM\_OWNER of a shmfile stream dies before calling fclose on the stream.

int  fshm\_force\_destroy(const char \*name);

	/**
	 * fshm_force_destroy - Forcibly destroy the shared memory region associated
	 *                       with #name.
	 *
	 *   Normal operation does not require this, however, if a process opens
	 *     a fshm stream as FSHM_OWNER, and does not close it before terminating,
	 *     the stream will maintain stuck open without an owner.
	 *
	 *
	 *    name - The name associated with this stream
	 *
	 *  NOTES - 
	 *
	 *   The owner should test for this, and forcibly destroy if required.
	 *
	 *   Like so:
	 *
	 *   FILE *fObj;
	 *
	 *   errno = 0;
	 *   fObj = fshm_open("/example1", 0775, FSHM_OWNER);

**Defined Constants**

*FSHM\_OWNER* - Used as a flag with fshm\_open to denote that the current process and user will create and own the shmfile stream.

*FSHM\_GUEST* - Used as a flag with fshm\_open to denote that we want to map an existing shmfile stream.


Examples
--------

The source code contains the following examples/tests of libshmfile which can be used as references:

**examples/owner** ( from examples/owner.c )  is an example that creates a stream ( as FSHM\_OWNER ),
 writes some data to it, and leaves it open for a period of time.

**examples/guest** ( from examples/guest.c )  is an example that connects to an existing stream ( as FSHM\_GUEST ),
 reads data from it, and prints it to stdout.


These examples test using a struct as data which is given initial values by "owner", and is updated each time "guest" is run.

The examples show both buffered I/O (fwrite and fflush), as well as unbuffered I/O (read and write).

Optionally, the fshm\_chgrp method will be used if you uncomment and set the SET\_GID\_MACRO at the top of examples/owner.c
