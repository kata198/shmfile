1.1.0 - Nov 13 2018

* Add FSHM_PERSIST flag as a possible option to be OR'd into fshm_flags on fshm_open.
 - When present, this will cause the shmfile to not be deleted when the FSHM_OWNER closes it.
 - The stream must be explicitly destroyed by fshm_force_destroy

* Add man page, available under: fshm_open, fshm_create, fshm_guest_open, fshm_force_destroy

* Cleanup Makefile a bit


1.0.0 - Jul 24 2018

* Makefile: updates, bugfixes, expansion, cleanup

 - Makefile: Remove *.o files as part of clean

 - Fix the static build of the lib (it was building a dynamic library named .a prior... whoops!)

 - Add a target, "install_static" which works the same way as "install" but only installs the archive (libshmfile.a)
 - Add a target, "static_debug" which recompiles the static lib using debug flags

 - Split out libshmfile.o into its own unit

* Cleanup and separate examples from base code

 - Create a new directory "examples"
 - Move 'owner.c' and 'guest.c' and 'owner_guest_private.h' into this 'examples' directory

 - Remove "examples" from the "all" target into its own target "examples" as the example code is not required to build libshmfile.so or libshmfile.a
  
  * Add "examples" target which will compile the example code
  * Add "examples_debug" target which will compile the example code with debug CFLAGS

* Ensure that the "mode" provided to fshm_open is actually applied to the file. Now you can properly define rights (read/write) to owning user, owning group (now modifable by fshm_chgrp), and all other.

* Implement a fshm_chmod function which can modify permissions afer a shmfile has been created

* Implement a fshm_chgrp function which changes the group associated with the shmfile ( i.e. members of this group get max permissions as specified by the "group" bit in the "mode" parameter )

* Add a new function, fshm_create(char *name, mode_t mode) for creating a new shmfile, which is a shorthand for fshm_open(name, mode, FSHM_OWNER)

* Add a new function, fshm_guest_open(char *name) for mapping an existing shmfile, which is a shorthand for fshm_open(name, 0, FSHM_GUEST)

* Update shmfile_get_version to use "unsigned char" instead of "char" for the version info (major, minor, patchlevel) as the version components will never be signed (negative)
